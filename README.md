# sqlalchemy-challenge

In this challenge, I utilized SQLAlchemy and Flask mainly. In it, I was given two csvs with data pertaining to percipitation and weather stations. I was tasked to import and analyze this data using SQLAlchemy.

The climate_starter.ipynb file contains the first set of code. I set up the session, base, and saved the tables to use later. Then, I answered various questions that prompted me to query the data set and use various filters. Ultimately, I wused matplotlib as well to help graph some of this data.

In the app.py file, I set up APIs to view the analysis that I had performed using Flask. With this toolset, you are able to use your browser to view different pages with the specific data.
